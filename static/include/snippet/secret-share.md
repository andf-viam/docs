{{< alert title="Caution" color="caution" >}}
Do not share your robot location secret, robot part secret, or robot address publicly.
Sharing this information compromises your system security by allowing unauthorized access to your robot, or to the computer running your robot.
It is good practice to note *where* and *when* you share a secret key.
