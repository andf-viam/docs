{{< alert title="Caution" color="caution" >}}
Do not share your location secret, part secret, or robot address publicly.
Sharing this information could compromise your system security by allowing unauthorized access to your robot, or to the computer running your robot.
Generally, it is good practice to note *where* and *when* you share a secret key, and to update all references to the key in your code as soon as possible after generating a new secret key, though Viam does support flexible key rotation with up to two keys in use at one time.
